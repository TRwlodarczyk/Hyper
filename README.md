# This is the hyperspectral research.

2 experiments have been set up

Experiment 1:
A halleri PL35 exposed to control 10uM, 500uM, 1000uM Zn
Every week measurements are taken
- hyper (30 cm distance between probe and pot)
- photosynthesis 3 leaves
- fresh biomass
- plant height
- root length
- leaf area
- LiDAR

Experiment 2:

A halleri PL27 control and sequential exposure to Zn
- 2 leaves harvest from each pot
- 2 leaves photosynthesis + 3 other leaves photosynthesis
- leaf mass, leaf area in the scanner
- 1 leaf for pigments, 1 for ICP-MS
